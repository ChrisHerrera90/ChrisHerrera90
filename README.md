Cybersecurity is a fascinating world that I never get bored of. I love the complex-problem solving nature of building out hands-on cybersecurity projects, there is never a dull moment! From vulnerability management to threat detection to cloud security, these projects allow me to dive deep into the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity. Please feel free to check them out and see the work I‚Äôve put into enhancing security operations and processes!
